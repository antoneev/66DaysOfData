## Current Problem 🥲

Newspapers currently produce papers above the reading level of the average American. It is reported that the average American reads at a 7th- to 8th-grade level. While newspapers are reported to be written at a 9th- to 15th-grade level, this leaves a huge disconnect as portions of society are unable to read articles. <br> Sources: [Reading Level](https://www.wyliecomm.com/2020/11/whats-the-latest-u-s-literacy-rate/#:~:text=The%20average%20American%20reads%20at%20the%207th%2D%20to%208th%2Dgrade,for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention) [Newspaper Level](http://www.impact-information.com/impactinfo/newsletter/plwork15.htm)

## Stakeholders  👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Anyone who may need assistance reading and/or breaking down complex words.

## Solution 🥳

This application aims to assist readers by finding and extracting complex words while displaying the words pronunciation and definitions in a pdf file.

# Challenges Found when conducting this Project 🥲

There is no dataset or package which contains "complex words". Therefore, I aimed to gather all words individuals should know by 8th grade. However, this list still missed different words. Thus, I attempted to assist this list by using the syllable count of a word.

# Future Work 🔮

Conducting this application with a better list of words.
