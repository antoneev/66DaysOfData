# Antone Evans Jr. 👨🏽‍💻 Takes on 66DaysOfData 

## The Goal 🏆
The goal of #66DaysOfData is to DO whether it's coding, studying, or completing a course. It's getting yourself in the habit of seeking new knowledge every day. The only caveat is to do it for at least 5 minutes a day. 

## My Take (Reasoning) 🎬
My reasoning behind participating in the #66DaysOfData was to better my current skills. At this current point, I'm a few months away from graduating. So, this is a great time, to build more projects and dig dipper into data science, machine and deep learning tools and concepts. More importantly, it allows me to keep myself accountable.

## Repos 🔑
Each project I complete will be added into this repo into a separate folder.
