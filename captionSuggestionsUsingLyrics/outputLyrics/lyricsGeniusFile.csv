Alexander All Alone,"[Verse 1: Andy Shauf]
Alexander all alone
Smoking a cigarette
The last pack he’d ever buy
At least that’s what he said
He stood up to stretch his back
And fell down to the ground

[Verse 2: Andy Shauf]
Alexander all alone
'Till the neighbour caught a glimpse
Cried out for his wife
To call the ambulance
Alexander all alone
Felt them check his pulse
He heard them pronounce him dead

[Chorus]
Hell is found inside of me
And nothing else will set me free
If hell is found inside of me
Then open me up and spill me out

[Verse 3: Andy Shauf]
Alexander wondered why
No life flashed before his eyes
Why his soul did not depart
Why he found no peace of mind
Would it take a little while?
Was it the same for everyone?
Alexander realized
[Chorus 2]
That hell is found inside of me
And nothing else will set me free
If hell is found inside of me
Then open me up and spill me out"
All the Same,"The greenest grass you'll ever see
Lies silent on the earth
Where I could never be
And the brightest sun that's ever shined
As you walk away
It dances there behind, or so I find
But it's all the same anyway

I'll hold you in the setting sun
Would that be boring
Would it be any fun for you
Maybe I could fix your pain
But what is life if it's always sunny
If there's never any rain
If it's all the same anyway, then it's all the same anyway

You are the mittens to my coldest hands
The purest rain to the driest lands
A brand new friend on a lonely day
Most beautiful girl I'd have to say
Please be mine on this very night
Hands are shaking, knees not quite
It's all the same anyway, well maybe it was but not today

Stay with me this little while because all I know is you make me smile"
Angela,"[Verse 1]
Angela, you need to write home
Send your mother a letter
Tell her that you're okay
'Cos i don't need the company
She's calling me like every single day

[Verse 2]
Angela, when you come home
Could you bring me back a carton of cigarettes?
When are you back anyway?
Everyone misses seeing your face

[Verse 3]
Angela, thanks for the postcard
Sounds like France is everything you dreamed
I know that we're not serious
But i wish that it could be the two of us

[Verse 4]
Angela, Jen let it out
That you had met some guy in Paris
Well let me know, 'cos that's okay
Really you don't need to say a thing

[Outro]
Angela, please come home
And tell us all your stories from far away
Angela, please come home
And tell us all your stories from far away
I bet that you would love to know
Everything that's happened here"
