The Magician,"[Verse 1]
Do you find
It gets a little easier each time you make it disappear?
Oh fools, the magician bends the rules
As the crowd watches his every move

[Chorus]
Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Verse 2]
Sidesteps to a death-defying feat
Wait for him to reappear
Look close, you’ll see him sweat the most
Each time his options disappear

[Chorus]
Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
I’m a shaking hand without a plan
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
[Outro]
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo"
Quite Like You,"Jeremy's so stoned I'd be surprised if he saw the tears in Sherry's eyes
She's standing in the corner staring at the floor
I wonder what the hell he did this time
Normally I wouldn't care to be so bold
Tonight I think I'll ask her what is wrong
She seems a bit embarrassed and I understand
I say ""I wish that you were having a good time.""

She says ""You know I've never really met someone like you.""
""You know I've never really met someone like you.""

I'm not one to speak up but I've had a few
So I start cutting Jeremy right in two
I said ""I don't know what you see in him,""
""It seems to me all he ever does is bring you down.""
I'm spilling my drink as I really start
Tearing one of my best friends apart
She's getting uneasy and my drunken speech ends as my hand finds its way to hers
I say ""You know I've never really met someone like you.""
""You know I've never really met someone like you.""
Jeremy walks over and, to my surprise, Sherry puts her arm around his side"
To You,"Jeremy can we talk a minute?
I've got some things that I need to
Get off of my chest

I know that we have had a few
And it's far too late
But if I wait I might never tell you
Can we find somewhere quiet?
Let's go outside
I've got some smokes if you've got a light
It's just that sometimes when I'm by your side
It feels so right
It feels like nothing could go wrong
Does it ever
Feel like that to you?
Does it ever
Feel like that to you?
Oh I don't know what I mean
It sounded wrong and I'm just tired
Not being weird
I just mean that you're a good friend
It's hard to explain
Just forget I said anything
Get over yourself
I'm not in love with you
It just came out all wrong
Yeah
Tell the guys and laugh it up
Why am I even surprised?
That it never
Feels like that to you
That it never
Feels like that to you
I guess it never
Feels like that to you
I guess it never
Feels like that to you"
